datalgo
=======

Datalgo is a repo containing various data structures and algorithms 
implementations in C and C++. It is not intented to be a library nor production 
ready.

Tested to compile only with clang on OS X but should compile without 
gcc 4.8+ and a recent cygwin version with C++11 support.
